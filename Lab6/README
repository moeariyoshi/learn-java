I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment. 

Did the JavaDoc for BinaryTree.java class.

Discussed lab directions with Simon Hunsinger. 

In TreeLoader.java:

Q. Why does the code not work without casting the tag strings into integers
and do if (leftTag == "1")?

In BinaryTreeTest.java:

Q. ArrayList<Integer> expected = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        expected.add(3);
        expected.add(5);
        expected.add(7);
        
        is there a better way to compare the list to the expected list?

TreeLoader

 4/4

EmptyTree

 -0.5 mirrorImage needs to return a new (Empty) tree, not "this"

 -0.5 pare needs to return a new (Empty) tree, not "this"

 -0.5 cutLeaves needs to return a new (Empty) tree, not "this"

 -0.5 diameter should return -1 not 0, because each connection between a node adds a 1, a tree with just a single node would have a diameter of 0,

 so if the tree is empty, the diameter is -1

 4.5/6.5

ConsTree

 -2 cutLeaves, does not cut leaves, cuts all but the root, shouldn't just return new empty trees, you should only return EmptyTree(s) when both the 

 left and right children are empty

 -1 levelCount this only gives an exception, does not print the number of nodes at each level

 -0.5 postOrderElements preOrderElements is used here when it should be postOrderElements

 -0.5 inOrderElements preOrderElements is used here when it should be postOrderElements

 11.5/15.5

BinaryTreeTest

 The tests for weightBalanceFactor is good, but you might want to test a tree that doesn't have a weight balance factor of 0
