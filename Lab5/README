1. How do the growth rates for ArrayList and Iterator compare?

While the growth rate for Iterator was exponential, Array List, remained linear. 

2. How do the growth rates for Iterator and Indexing compare?

Iterator and Indexing both grow in an exponential rate. 
Indexing grows at a bigger rate than Iterator. 

3. If you were tasked with storing data in a list and you needed to
   sequentially examine elements in the list, which approach would you take
   and why?
   
   Although it will take more time, I will choose the Iterator method because it can make sure the data is examined in the right sequence. 
   
   
   
   Notes: 
   It's important that I don't increment the size before I add the Nodes because I can't add special cases when size == 0
