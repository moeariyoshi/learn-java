README

I moved the warmup package into the same src folder that the lab3 was in. 
I don't know if I was supposed to do that 
but the test program don't seem to be working anymore with the same code. 

Grade: 46/50
Comments: 
minus points for the out of bounds(-2) and set(-2) codes in the myarraylisttest. 

UDPATE:

I had forgotten to use assertThrows so I fixed that.
