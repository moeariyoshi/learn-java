I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment. 

Tree 1 
A: -1 - (-1) = 0
B: 0 - (-1) = 1
H: 1 - (-1) = 2   
UNBALANCED!

Tree 2
A: 0 
B: 0 - (-1) = 1
H: 1 - 0 = 1
M: 0
BALANCED!

Tree 3
A: 0
B: 0 
C: 0
H: 1 - 0 = 1
M: 0
BALANCED!

Tree 4
A: 0
B: 0
C: 0
H: 1 - (-1) = 2 
UNBALANCED!

ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION - inserting 80 

	30
	/\
 15    45
 /\    /\
5 20 35 75   <- left rotation at node 60
		/\
	   60 80 


Notes:

this.compareTo(that)
returns:
a negative if this < that
0 if this == that
a positive if this > that

Question: Graders, I would appreciate it if you could answer this. Thank you!
- How does restructure know the first node that is unbalanced from the bottom?
